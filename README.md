* Compile WoWFix using Visual Studio 2022.
  Alternatively you can download compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/robinsch/WoWFix335/releases).
* This version of WoWFix will continue to pull changes that Robin makes. I'm simply just merging in any WoW EXE modifications that I've come across into this REPO. 
* Please do not request any form of EXE modifications from me.. I am simply a monkey. If you want any of the EXE changes taken out.. compile yourself and comment out or remove what you don't want.
