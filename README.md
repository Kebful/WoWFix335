WoWFix335 // Kebful Edition
=====================

WoWFix335 is binary patcher to fix various issues in World of Warcraft 3.3.5 client version.

Usage - Modified by Kebful
-----
* Compile WoWFix using Visual Studio 2022.
  Alternatively you can download compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/robinsch/WoWFix335/releases).
* This version of WoWFix will continue to pull changes that Robin makes. I'm simply just merging in any WoW EXE modifications that I've come across into this REPO. 
* Please do not request any form of EXE modifications from me.. I am simply a monkey. If you want any of the EXE changes taken out.. compile yourself and comment out or remove what you don't want.

ItemDBCDisabler.py
* For some reason I could not get the Item DBC Disabler from TWOW to work with Robin's patcher. 
It kept bricking my entire EXE everytime I tried to run it. Ended up just prompting GPT to make a PY script out of it for me.
* Must have Python installed
* Must have EXE in the same folder as the py script
* Open CMD in the same directory of the PY script and EXE
* After CMD is opened type in py itemdbcdisabler.py
* Enter the path to the World of Warcraft executable:
  In my case I just typed in wow.exe 

Cheers!
