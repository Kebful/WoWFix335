WoWFix335 // Kebful Edition
=====================

WoWFix335 is binary patcher to fix various issues in World of Warcraft 3.3.5 client version.

Usage - Modified by Kebful
-----

* Compile WoWFix using Visual Studio 2022.
  Alternatively you can download compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/robinsch/WoWFix335/releases).
* This version of WoWFix will continue to pull changes that Robin makes. I'm simply just merging in any WoW EXE modifications that I've come across into this REPO. 
* Please do not request any form of EXE modifications from me.. I am simply a monkey. If you want any of the EXE changes taken out.. compile yourself and comment out or remove what you don't want.

ItemDBCDisabler - 
----
For some reason I could not get the Item DBC Disabler from TWOW to work with Robin's patcher. 
It kept bricking my entire EXE everytime I tried to run it. Ended up just prompting GPT to make a PY script out of it for me.

* Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
* Ensure that the World of Warcraft executable (wow.exe) is located in the same folder as the Python script (itemdbcdisabler.py).
* Open Command Prompt (CMD) in the directory where both the Python script and the WoW executable are located.
* Once CMD is open, type the following command: py itemdbcdisabler.py and press Enter.
* The script will prompt you to enter the path to the World of Warcraft executable. For example, you can type wow.exe and press Enter.
* The script will then apply the patches to the WoW executable.
* After the patches are applied successfully, you can close Command Prompt.
Following these steps should help you use the Python script to apply the Item DBC Disabler patches to your World of Warcraft executable without encountering any issues.

Cheers!
